# NFT image puzzle game thing

## Idea

The idea behind this project was to turn an original digital art piece into several NFTs by splitting the image and releasing the subimages individually. The purpose wasn't to earn more crypto per NFT (I planned on pricing each subimage at P/N, where P is the value at which I'd price the whole art piece and N is the number of sugimages generated from the original piece), but rather to make it fun and interesting for collectors. Individual holders could trade the subimages and try to collect them all to form the complete piece.

The next step would be to create a web app where an NFT holder could enter their public address (for Ethereum or Solana, depending on which platform I decided to use) and the app would determine whether they held all subimages. This part I haven't figured out yet, so at present the only piece of the project I've completed is the Python script that divides the image into subimages.
